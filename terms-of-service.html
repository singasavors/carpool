  <h1>Terms of Service (ToS)</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 22 March 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Singasavor, a multi-service booking platform connecting users with licensed service providers in Singapore and Malaysia. These Terms of Service outline your rights and responsibilities when using our platform. By accessing or using any part of Singasavor, you acknowledge and agree to be legally bound by these terms.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
  <p>
    Singasavor acts as a digital intermediary to facilitate the booking and coordination of a variety of services provided by third-party vendors. These services include but are not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transportation services (e.g., cross-border transport, school pickups, carpool arrangements)</li>
    <li>Moving services and general travel logistics</li>
    <li>Event management and funeral setup arrangements</li>
    <li>Accommodation booking and pet transportation solutions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Please note that Singasavor does not directly manage, operate, or provide any of the listed services. All services are delivered by verified, independently licensed providers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Booking and Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>
    Users are not required to create an account to make a booking or subscribe to a service. Instead, information submitted through our platform's forms is automatically relayed to the relevant service provider. Service providers are responsible for handling all user interactions from that point onward, including pricing and scheduling.
  </p>
  <p>
    By submitting a form on our platform, you express your intention to engage in a contractual relationship directly with the service provider concerned.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Payments</h2>
  <p>
    All payments made via Singasavor are processed securely through our partner gateway, Cryptosgpay. We use modern encryption methods to protect your sensitive data and ensure all transactions are secure from unauthorized access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Refunds and cancellations are governed by the terms of the respective service providers. Users are encouraged to review each provider’s individual policies before confirming a booking.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Disputes and Mediation</h2>
  <p>
    In the event of a disagreement or conflict between a user and a service provider, Singasavor can offer assistance as a mediator. However, the final decision-making authority lies with the service provider. We do not enforce any binding resolution.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Insurance and Liability</h2>
  <p>
    Services conducted in Singapore include insurance coverage as mandated by local law. For services rendered in Malaysia, users must rely on their personal insurance plans for protection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Singasavor is not liable for damages, delays, losses, or any mishaps resulting from the services provided. We serve purely as a booking intermediary and do not assume responsibility for operational outcomes.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Communication</h2>
  <p>
    By using our platform, you consent to receive relevant communications from Singasavor, including but not limited to booking confirmations, service updates, and promotional content. Communications may be sent via email, WhatsApp, or Telegram.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may unsubscribe from promotional communications at any time by contacting our support team or following the opt-out instructions provided in the message.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Jurisdiction and Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms of Service shall be governed and interpreted according to the laws of Singapore. Any disputes arising in relation to these terms will fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore.
